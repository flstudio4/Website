        <h2><a href="#">&nbsp;General Computer Slowdowns</a></h2>
        <div>
            <p>One of the most common problems users have with their computer is that it is "running slow."
                This can be caused by many things. However, typically it is referring to the time it takes
                to turn on the PC, open programs, or do just about anything. In some extreme cases, this can
                even mean input lag from your keyboard to what appears on the screen. This issue can be
                incredibly frustrating, because it can affect multiple programs or areas on your computer
                and seriously reduce productivity.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2><a href="#">PC Will NOT Turn On</a></h2>
        <div>
            <p>Pressing the power button on your computer and having nothing happen can feel like the end of the world.
                Luckily, power issues do not necessarily mean the entire PC is broken or that data has been lost. Both
                desktops and laptops can refuse to turn on for a number of reasons. Sometimes it can even be just a
                peripheral such as an external monitor that is having problems and stopping the PC from turning on
                entirely. If you press the power button to start your PC and nothing happens, do not panic. Remember
                to give the computer a moment to fully power-on before pressing the power or reset button again.
                If you are still having issues, try some quick fixes below! Laptops are more prone to power issues
                than desktops due to their external power supplies and internal batteries. If there is any damage to
                a laptop charger or internal battery, most modern laptops will prevent themselves from powering on to
                prevent the faulty equipment from causing any more damage. When possible to do safely, you can fully
                power-down and unplug the machine, then remove the battery before trying to turn off the PC again.
                If this solution solves the problem, then most likely, it is time to replace your battery. If this does
                not fix the issue, try using a different AC adapter with and without the battery to determine if either
                of those devices is causing the startup issue. With desktops, power issues are more straightforward
                but can be more complicated. 99% of desktop computers will have a power button on the front of the case
                and a power switch on the back of the case near where the power cord plugs in. Desktop computers will
                not power unless the power switch in the back is turned on, and the button in the front is pressed. This
                is always the first thing you should check when experiencing power issues on a desktop PC. If this does
                not solve your problem, you can carefully open your case when the computer is powered off to see if your
                power supply is connected properly to your other computer components. It is safe to reseat connections
                and remove any excess dust or debris in the case. However, it is not recommended for average users to remove
                or change internal power supply connections.

        <h2><a href="#">Peripherals Not Working</a></h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                Sometimes the most annoying problems are not with your computer itself but rather with the peripherals
                you are trying to use with the machine. Keyboards and mice see a tremendous amount of daily use, so it
                is not uncommon for them to fail on occasion. Other devices such as microphones or presentation-based
                remotes can have complicated setup processes that can create potential issues later down the road. When
                any of these devices fail to work properly, they can create costly and annoying downtime that is not
                ideal for any user. The first thing to check when an external device is not working is its connection to
                the computer. Cables can easily break, or ports can be obstructed. Before getting into any more serious
                solutions, it is always best practice to try using different cables or connections on your machine to see
                if a device will begin working again. If the cable or hardware itself is not the issue, you can try
                reinstalling drivers to see if that fixes the problem. Drivers are the software your PC uses to
                communicate with and utilize hardware properly. All devices from keyboards to Wi-Fi cards have drivers.
                Sometimes, they can become corrupt or fail to update properly, and that can create issues when trying to
                use your devices. A quick way to see if you are having driver issues is to check Device Manager. This is
                an area of your settings you can get to by searching or right-clicking your start menu. Once in Device
                Manager, you will see a list of all the hardware connected to your computer. If any piece of hardware
                has issues, there will be an exclamation point next to the device. This means the device is detected by
                your computer but not working as intended. There are two solutions you can try from here to get your
                device up and running again: First, you can right-click and update the drivers for the device. This will
                require a restart but can be a quick and easy way to implement this fix. If updating does not work,
                you can also try reinstalling the drivers. To do this, right-click the device again, but this time click
                "Uninstall Drivers" and then restart your PC. This removes the current drivers from your machine and then
                installs the proper drivers once the computer restarts.

        <h2><a href="#">Audio Issues</a></h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                Virtual meetings have become standard these days, and so have a host of audio issues that can make using
                your PC unbearable. Microphones can get accidentally muted, or audio sources can switch within different
                programs. Hardware can fail, but it is uncommon. More often than not, sound issues can be resolved from
                within the operating system. However, there are multiple ways to access and change sound settings, so
                troubleshooting issues can be frustrating when waiting for a virtual meeting or video call to start.
                Most keyboards, headsets, or microphones come with a dedicated mute button. When dealing with sound
                issues, it is always best practice to check these functions and buttons first. Accidental button or key
                presses can sometimes mute audio sources in programs or your entire PC audio. When all of your devices
                connect as intended, and you are still having audio issues, the next step is to check and see if your
                volume is low or muted from within your operating system. If you are still experiencing audio problems,
                the last thing you can check is your playback sources. By right-clicking your speaker icon, you can bring
                up your audio settings, which will show you a list of available audio devices. You can then test each one
                with the press of a button and ensure the proper device is selected for your PC. Unfortunately, if none of
                these software fixes worked, it could be a hardware issue. If your PC's generic audio driver (found
                within the 3.5mm headphone jack) isn't working or isn't compatible with some features of your headphones,
                you can look for a USB headset â€” the USB connection will work around any issues with the driver and often
                fixes any software compatibility issues with the headset.

        <h2><a href="#">BSoD (Blue Screen of Death)</a></h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                The most terrifying of computer problems is the dreaded blue screen of death. This term refers to the
                blue error screen that appears when your computer has a critical failure of some kind. Blue screens can
                result in data loss or worse and need to be addressed immediately. OS updates can sometimes result in
                blue screen errors, and if that's the case, you can usually fix the issue yourself. Commonly, there is
                an error code associated with a blue screen, so you should try to write that information down when
                possible. If it is a more severe issue, IT professionals can use those codes to help diagnose and repair
                your computer more efficiently. There are, however, a few things you can try carefully to fix blue
                screens and prevent a costly repair bill. If you get a blue screen error that looks like it is
                the operating system or software related, you may be able to fix it yourself. If the error code you see
                has to do with hardware, you should not attempt to work on the computer yourself, because you could risk
                further damaging your PC. When software issues cause blue screens, the first thing you should do is let
                the system turn off and try to reboot on its own. Modern computers have functions and features that will
                automatically attempt to repair these issues. Sometimes a simple restart and wait could fix random blue
                screens. When automatic tools fail to work, there are other solutions you can attempt. You can use
                an operating system installation tool to try and roll back updates or run more advanced repair tools
                without the risk of further damaging hardware. The last thing you could try would be to reinstall
                the operating system on the PC. Just remember you need to be incredibly careful when doing this because
                you could lose all of your data without the proper backups in place.
