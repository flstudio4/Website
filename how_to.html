        <h2><a href="#">Computer Slowdowns</a></h2>
        <div class="hide">
            <p>One of the most common problems users have with their computer is that it is "running slow."
                This can be caused by many things. However, typically it is referring to the time it takes
                to turn on the PC, open programs, or do just about anything. In some extreme cases, this can
                even mean input lag from your keyboard to what appears on the screen. This issue can be
                incredibly frustrating, because it can affect multiple programs or areas on your computer
                and seriously reduce productivity.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2><a href="#">PC Will NOT Turn On</a></h2>
        <div class="hide">
            <p>Pressing the power button on your computer and having nothing happen can feel like the end of the world.
                Luckily, power issues do not necessarily mean the entire PC is broken or that data has been lost. Both
                desktops and laptops can refuse to turn on for a number of reasons. Sometimes it can even be just a
                peripheral such as an external monitor that is having problems and stopping the PC from turning on
                entirely. If you press the power button to start your PC and nothing happens, do not panic. Remember
                to give the computer a moment to fully power-on before pressing the power or reset button again.

        <h2><a href="#">Peripherals Not Working</a></h2>
        <div class="hide">
            <p>
                Sometimes the most annoying problems are not with your computer itself but rather with the peripherals
                you are trying to use with the machine. Keyboards and mice see a tremendous amount of daily use, so it
                is not uncommon for them to fail on occasion. Other devices such as microphones or presentation-based
                remotes can have complicated setup processes that can create potential issues later down the road. When
                any of these devices fail to work properly, they can create costly and annoying downtime that is not
                ideal for any user.
            </p>

        <h2><a href="#">Audio Issues</a></h2>
        <div class="hide">
            <p>
                Virtual meetings have become standard these days, and so have a host of audio issues that can make using
                your PC unbearable. Microphones can get accidentally muted, or audio sources can switch within different
                programs. Hardware can fail, but it is uncommon. More often than not, sound issues can be resolved from
                within the operating system.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2><a href="#">Blue Screen of Death</a></h2>
        <div class="hide">
            <p>
                The most terrifying of computer problems is the dreaded blue screen of death. This term refers to the
                blue error screen that appears when your computer has a critical failure of some kind. Blue screens can
                result in data loss or worse and need to be addressed immediately. OS updates can sometimes result in
                blue screen errors, and if that's the case, you can usually fix the issue yourself. Commonly, there is
                an error code associated with a blue screen, so you should try to write that information down when
                possible.

    <div id="tips">
        <p>When something goes seriously wrong with your laptop, you usually receive an advance warning. A virus might
            alter your security settings, for example, or a failing hard drive might start making funny noises. If you
            catch these signals early, you can quickly diagnose and fix your computer.</p>

        <p>Many of our recommended solutions involve a thorough malware scan. If you haven’t already installed antivirus
            and anti-malware programs on your system, do that now. You can rely on the build-in Windows or macOS programs,
            or go shopping for another security suite. Just make sure to put in the research: Check out an online buying
            guide for Windows or macOS, read up on user and professional reviews, and find the right set of tools for your
            needs. Don’t let price deter you—solid computer security is worth the money.</p>
